This course was run over three evenings (2 hours per evening) in May 2012 at StartupChile to teach two groups (total: 25 people) Python. It is aimed at people who have a previous programming education.

The group needs Python 2.7 with IDLE, we solve the first three PythonChallenge.com challenges to help students practice with IDLE and learn how to solve their own problems.
